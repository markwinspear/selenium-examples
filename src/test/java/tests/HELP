SAUCELABS
VM option: -Dhost=saucelabs
(This is entered in the VM options currently for each test - need to set up a parameters file I think
Local execution: -Dhost=localhost

The saucerest library has been added to the pom.xml so we can set a pass or fail in the saucelabs dashboard instead of just showing as "Finished"

Maven surefire plugin used to parallalize tests - pom.xml updated as per Chapter 14

Categories set up using Maven surefire - Smoke & Deep categories can be applied to individual @Test or classes
 To run only a subset of tests, use -Dgroups=tests.groups.Smoke or -Dgroups=tests.groups.Deep otherwise all will be run as default (specified in the pom.xml)
 can also use -Dgroups=tests.groups.Shallow,test.groups.Deep

@Override annotation was added to the staring method in tests/Base.java (book does not have this but video walkthrough does and without it,
 saucelabs tests show as "unnamed job" and don't have a "pass" or "fail"

 See Chapter 13 to run tests in saucelabs for applications behind a firewall
